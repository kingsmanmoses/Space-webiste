                    <h1>Mercury</h1> is named after the Roman god of commerce, 
                    travel, and thievery. 
                    In Greek mythology, Mercury was known as Hermes,
                     the messenger of the gods. 
                    It probably received this name because it moves very quickly across the sky.

                    Key Facts & Summary
                </h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun at 
                        a distance of 57 million kilometers / 35 
                        million miles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Out of all the terrestrial planets, 
                        Mercury is the smalle
                        It is also the smallest planet in the Solar System.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Despite being so small, Mercury is the second-densest planet in the Solar System after Earth. This means it is very compact.
                    Mercury does not have any satellites or ring systems.
                    </li>
                    The surface of Mercury is similar to the Moon.
                     It is the most heavily cratered planet and this means that it hasn’t
                      been geologically active for many years.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Mercury has a radius of 2.439 km / 1.516 mi and a 
                    diameter of 4.879 km / 3.032 mi.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Though it is the closest planet to the Sun, 
                    temperatures on Mercury are both hot and cold.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    During the day, Mercury’s average surface temperatures can reach up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit / 430 degrees Celsius.
                    At night, Mercury’s surface temperatures can drop to as low as -290 degrees Fahrenheit / -180 degrees Celsius.
                    Mercury’s changes in temperature are the most drastic in the Solar System.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Mercury formed around 4.5 billion years ago after gravity pulled swirling gases and dust together.
                    After Mercury was formed, scientists believe that it suffered heavy bombardments by comets and asteroids shortly after. Another event called the Late Heavy Bombardment which ended around 3.8 billion years ago, may also be responsible for Mercury’s cratered surface.
                    Almost 85% of Mercury’s radius is represented by its enormous iron core.
                    Due to the core’s unusual size, Mercury began to shrink as the core cooled and contracted pulling the surface inward.

                        In Greek mythology, she is known as Aphrodite. The planet was named after this goddess because,
                         for the ancient people, it shinned the brightest.

                    <li>
                        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and the third-largest planet in the Solar System It is the biggest of the ice giants.

                    <li>
                        Uranus is 2.9 billion kilometers / 1.8 billion miles away from the Sun.

                    <li>
                        Uranus has a radius of 25.362 km / 15.759 mi, and a diameter of 51.118 km or 31.763 mi.

                    </li>
                    It comparison to Earth’s mass, Uranus has around 14.5 times the mass of Earth. It has the fourth-largest mass in the Solar System.

                    <li>
                        Uranus rotates in the opposite direction than most planets, from East to West. It is also the only planet known to rotate on its side.

                    <li>
                        Uranus has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System. Temperatures are on average at around -224 degrees Celsius / -371 degrees Fahrenheit.

                    <li>
                        Both Uranus and Neptune share similar compositions. Their chemical compositions differ from the other gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. Because of this, Uranus and Neptune are classified as ice giants rather than gas giants, for easier distinction.

                    <li>
                        Uranus has a similar atmosphere to Jupiter and Saturn in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium. However, it contains more “ices” such as water, ammonia, methane, and traces of other hydrocarbons.
